Face detection for Twilio Programmable Video

![Face detection example](example.gif)

To run this example, the files in the `public` directory need to be served
through a web server of your choice. If you have a standard Python 3
installation, you can start a web server as follows:

    python3 -m http.server -d public

And then open the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` on your
web browser.
